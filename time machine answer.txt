If I had a time machine for 24 hours, I’d split my day between two places.

First, I’d go back to early 2000 and spend the morning in Silicon Valley, right before the dot-com crash. I’ve always been fascinated by how markets behave in times of irrational exuberance. It would be incredible to feel the buzz in the air, hear the pitches, and see how quickly confidence can turn into panic. And yes — I’d probably sneak in a small investment in Amazon or Apple while I’m at it.

Then, for the evening, I’d fly to Salt Lake City to watch Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals — Bulls vs. Jazz.
Even though I’m a LeBron fan, witnessing Michael Jordan’s iconic last shot in a Chicago Bulls jersey, live, in that moment of clutch greatness, would be absolutely unforgettable.

I think both moments — one in tech and one in sports — represent boldness, risk-taking, and pushing limits. That’s the kind of energy that inspires me in life and at work.
